## Why Kova?

Using AI coding agents every day, I kept running into the same friction in the terminal — **memory getting heavy** as sessions grow, **managing tmux and worktrees through CLI** every time, and **no way to see at a glance** which commits came from which agent.

Kova started from that experience:

- **Stable terminal** — xterm.js runs with zero scrollback buffer; all history is delegated to tmux, keeping the WebView memory footprint constant regardless of session length
- **Visual tmux & worktree** — manage panes, windows, and worktrees through GUI instead of CLI commands
- **AI agent awareness** — auto-detect agent commits, monitor activity, zero-config hook injection

## Features

### Embedded Terminal with tmux

Full terminal emulator (xterm.js 6.0) with native tmux integration. Split panes, multiple windows, and session persistence across app restarts. The terminal renders only the visible viewport — scroll history lives entirely in tmux's server process, so the app's memory stays flat even after hours of heavy output. 22+ stability fixes for Korean IME, CPU spikes, and sleep/wake recovery.

### AI-Aware Git Graph

Visual git log with automatic agent attribution badges. Hover a worktree card to highlight its entire branch lane — and vice versa. Infinite scroll with virtual rendering for large repositories.

### Commit Detail with Agent Attribution

See exactly which commits were AI-generated. Full diff viewer with line-by-line highlighting and `Co-Authored-By` trailer detection. One click from graph to full diff.

### Working Changes

Stage, unstage, and commit directly from the git graph. Per-worktree dirty state tracking with file-level diff view.

### Multi-Agent Support

Supports **Claude Code**, **Codex CLI**, and **Gemini CLI**. Hook injection is automatic — create a project, and Kova installs the necessary hooks. Codex (which lacks hook support) is monitored via background process detection.

### Worktree Management

Create agent worktrees, assign tasks, track dirty state, and merge back to main — all from the GUI. Bidirectional cross-highlighting between worktree cards and git graph branches.

### Theme & Font Customization

12 dark terminal themes (Dracula, Nord, Catppuccin, Gruvbox, and more) and 9 font presets (JetBrains Mono, Cascadia Code, Iosevka, and more). Adjustable terminal opacity.

### Keyboard-Driven Workflow

Full keyboard shortcut system — ⌘/ shortcut help, ⌘K command palette, ⌘1-9 project switching, ⌘⇧G terminal/git toggle, ⌘P file search, and more.

### File Explorer & Editor

![File Editor](docs/assets/screenshots/screenshot-file-editor.png)

Browse project files with a virtualized tree. Built-in CodeMirror editor with syntax highlighting for 60+ languages. ⌘P fuzzy search, ⌘⇧F content search, and ⌘Click import navigation.

### SSH Remote

Connect to remote machines over SSH. Full terminal + git graph support on remote projects, with the same UX as local.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- macOS 13+ Ventura (Apple Silicon or Intel)
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) installed (`brew install tmux`)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed
- At least one AI coding agent: [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), or [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)

### Install via Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew tap newExpand/kova
brew install --cask kova
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Kova.app
```

### Download DMG

1. Download from the [latest release](https://github.com/newExpand/kova/releases/latest):
   - Apple Silicon: [Kova_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg](https://github.com/newExpand/kova/releases/latest/download/Kova_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg)
   - Intel: [Kova_0.1.0_x64.dmg](https://github.com/newExpand/kova/releases/latest/download/Kova_0.1.0_x64.dmg)
2. Open the DMG, drag **Kova** to Applications.
3. On first launch, macOS will block the app because it is not notarized. Remove the quarantine flag:
   ```bash
   xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Kova.app
   ```
   Then open Kova normally.

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/newExpand/kova.git
cd kova
bun install
bun tauri build
```

The `.dmg` will be in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/`.

> **Note**: Kova is macOS-only. Windows and Linux are not currently supported. See [Roadmap](#roadmap) for Linux plans.
